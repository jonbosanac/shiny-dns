DNS Analyzer - Shiny App

This document shows how to use the Shiny app to visualize DNS data.
Sidebar

On the sidebar there are two options, Plot and Data.
Data

In this panel you can check how the data looks after it was transformed and merged together. This process has to be done before deploying the app. To do that just add the csv ﬁles to the data folder and run the prepare_data.R script.
You can use the search bar to search for speciﬁc things in the data and sort by column by clicking on the column name. You can also check how many entries are by going to the bottom of the table.
This tool is designed to work with the DNS MTR comparison tool.
